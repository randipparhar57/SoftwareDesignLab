            <center><p>Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 could be described as lonely. A lot of hanging out by myself. I would go to the park a lot. It's nice during this time of the year because it's not as crowded as it is during the summer. There aren't any bugs and pests. It's not super hot and humid. The park looks bigger and more vast because of how empty it is. I would go during sunrise before work to center myself for the day ahead.</p>
            <p>Lots of train rides, too. I would try to ride on above ground trains so that I still had access to wifi to listen to music and get directions in case I got lost. I went to a lot of places that I've never been to before despite being raised in New York City for most of my life. There was this whole world out there that was completely unknown to me, despite it's proximity.</p>
            <p>There were plenty of instances where I felt overwhelmed and wished I had a hand to hold to let me know I'm not alone. But it was me, myself, and I that I had to depend on. Until a very dear friend of mine recognized I needed help and helped me get it. So, if this chapter came to an end, it was because of them.</p>
            <p>“… that’s what friends do. They care. They find each other and stick together when things get rough. Friends are worth the effort.” - Fabio Moon, Daytripper</p></center>
