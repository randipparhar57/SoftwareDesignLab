                <h2>Nostalgia NYC</h2>
                <h3>DHUM 71000 - Expressive Web Project</h3>
                <h3>The Graduate Center of the City University of New York</h3>
                <h4>12.16.2022</h4>

                <p>Nostalgia: a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. There is a trend on social media on sharing moments that altered one's brain chemistry. People would share key memories of the past with their loved ones. In a world that is moving so fast, it makes sense that one would feel nostalgic for simpler days and simpler times.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this project, Nostalgia NYC, is for me to share memories from my upbringing in New York City. This isn't everything; for the sake of this project, I chose to focus on key memories. Eventually, I would like to build this into an interactive storybook chronicling the adventures of my life. To give some background, here are some reasons why I am very invested in saving these memories:</p>

                <li>I am scared that when I get older, I'm going to forget what everyone in my life looks like. Having pictures will allow me to always remember what they look like.</li>
                <li>I want to save these memories so that I can document our family history. My parents immigrated to the United States and that's historic. They are first generation Americans and because of the sacrifices that they made, we are here, living in one of the greatest cities in the world.</li>
                <li>I am so grateful for my upbringing and for living the life I'm living. I have so many fond memories of exploring the city with my mom as she took public transportation to run errands, spending time with my family, meeting amazing people, and taking part in awesome experiences (picnics, concerts, night drives to the beach, evening walks in the park under the starlit sky). Even though in the grand scheme of everything, these things seem very simple, they mean the world to me because I feel like it's the little things that we remember the most - these small moments are tokens of love.</li>
                <li>Life is a journey. There are ups and downs, each one playing an important part in our development. It's nice to be able to feel joy as I look back on happy memories, laugh and cringe over embarassing ones, and take solace in the fact that I was able to overcome difficult times.</li>

                <p>So, with that, here is Nostalgia NYC. As you scroll down, the map will move to different parts of New York City. Mostly Queens because I was raised and live in Queens. Clicking on the heart icon will allow you to listen to songs that remind me of that place.</p>

                <h4>Key Memories</h4>

                <p>Memory 1</p>
                <p>I was four years old when my sister was born. It was the first time mom and I were apart since she was in the hospital. I remember dad took me to Napoli's, the greatest pizza of all time. He took me to the park afterwards. It may not seem like a big deal. However, just like how it was my first time apart from mom, it was also dad's first time apart as well. I spent more time with mom since dad worked a lot. So, I wondered if he knew me as well as mom did since we didn't spend as much time together. But, in this moment, he showed me that he understood me. And even though we don't spend as much time together as he and I would like to, in the time we do spend together, he is paying attention to me and he is making an effort to understand me and who I am. He takes the effort to remember little things that make me who I am.</p>

                <p>Memory 2</p>
                <p>Eventually, my sister and mom came home. Up until this point, I was an only child. I was also a pretty quiet kid. And now, with a baby in the house, there was all this extra noise and chaos. I don't recall doing this, but my parents do and it has been a running joke for two decades now. I took a black garbage bag and went to mom. She asked me what it was for. I told her, "To throw her out. If we leave her on the curb, the garbage men will take her away." I promise, I do not hold this disdain for my sister now. My mother explained to me my new reality of being an older sibling and not long after, I accepted her. And today, she is my ride or die, my one and true BFF. We would do anything for each other. She's the best.</p>

                <p>Memory 3</p>
                <p>Our neighbor, Patricia, lived on the second floor of the house. She was the best. Her house always smelled like wafers and she was always giving us deserts. Some kids close to my age lived on the top floor of the house. On one occassion, she took all of us to the city. She drove us in her Toyota Camry and took us to FAO Schwarz, Dylan's Candy Shop, and Rockefeller Center. At that point, I was nine years old. We didn't really venture to Manhattan a lot, so it was exciting to see how different the world looked 20 minutes away. The highlight of the day was me being able to say hi to the woman I would see on NY1 Spectrum News as they took a break between recording. Also, the Italian food we had for lunch since it was my first having Italian food. I put way too much parmesan on my spaghetti.</p>

                <p>Memory 4</p>
                <p>Once during the summer before sixth grade, my mother took my sister and I on the train to run errands. We eventually reached Coney Island. I remember asking my mom if we could go to Coney Island after she was done with her errands. And my mom said, "What errands? Welcome to Coney Island." It was the best surprise and I remember being so excited. The fact that gum got stuck on my shorts during the train ride there didn't even bother me anymore because we were in Coney Island baby!</p>

                <h4>Key Memories</h4>

                <p>Memory 1</p>
                <p>High School Musical and Camp Rock both premiered when I was in elementary school. I don't really remember the premiere of High School Musical, but I do remember how obsessed by fifth grade teacher was with Zac Efron. I do recall the premiere of Camp Rock because it happened on the last day of fifth grade. It was iconic. The second movie doesn't hold a candle to the original.</p>

                <p>Memory 2</p>
                <p>My fifth grade graduation and my sister's kindergarten graduation happened in the same year. Now, if you look at the images above, you'll notice that we are both wearing flower girl dresses. I was aware that I was wearing a flower girl dress. My mother insisted that it was the perfect dress for graduation. You'll notice that my mom really likes dressing us up in white dresses, white shirts, and white shoes for school functions. I still cringe at the fact that I wore a flower girl dress. And knee high socks with the dress in June! Moms, am I right?</p>
                
                <p>Memory 3</p>
                <p>Do you see that teacher in the picture? That's Ms. Hyman, my kindergarten teacher. She was the best teacher a kid could ever ask for. It was because of her that I decided at the young age of five years old that I wanted to be a teacher. She made me fall in love with school and learning.</p>

                <h4>Key Memories</h4>

                <p>Memory 1</p>
                <p>My dad worked close to Corona Park. During the summer, we would take the bus to Corona Park a few hours before my dad would get off work. We would spend hours riding the carousel. My dad would meet us at the park and we would all drive home in the car.</p>

                <p>Memory 2</p>
                <p>I went to the Queens Zoo three times in my life. Once on a school trip in elementary school. Once with my mom and sister during middle school since my mom had never went before that. And then once more when my little cousins and aunt came to visit us during my high school graduation. I remember the second time I went, it was a cool and brisk fall day. That picture of me in the pink and green checkered jacket was taken with a disposable camera! Remember those? The reason I remember that day was because it was the most autumn day that I remember experiencing. It was the perfect day.</p>

                <p>Memory 3</p>
                <p>During the summer of 2014, a new bike rental place opened in the park. They had all sorts of different bikes and my sister and I rode every single type of bike they had. The minimum amount of time for each rental was one hour. At first, my sister and I would worry how little time that was. But then, we realized that it was actually a lot of time. We would ride nonstop during that one hour and would get so tired. The worst rental was the one where two people would have to ride one bike. It was so hard to navigate because we would never be in sync. Ultimately, we agreed to take turns as one person put more effort than the other. Also, those things are super hard to turn! But it was a summer of fun and leg exhaustion.</p>

                <h4>Key Memories</h4>

                <p>Memory 1</p>
                <p>During the first week of freshman year, I was having trouble finding the girls gym. I asked a boy if he could help direct me to the girls gym. I thought he said, "sure, follow me." So, I followed him... all the way to the boys gym. I asked him, "Hey, this isn't the girls gym?" And he asked me, "What, why'd you follow me?" And I said, "Oh, I thought you said you were going to show me where the gym was." It was so embarassing and I still cringe when I think of that. Definitely did more cringey and embarassing stuff afterwards, but this is up there.</p>

                <p>Memory 2</p>
                <p>I was in the Carl Sagan Math and Science Research Program. All ninth graders would participate in a science fair. The theme that year was on plants and plant growth, something like that. My partner and I decided to research the effect different pollinators would have on the growth of the plants. So, one very cold winter night, my mother and I went to the city to go to a store that sold dead bugs. The store was somewhere near Prince Street. We spent $40 dollars on four dead bees or beetles. I don't even remember. I am just wondering how stupid my train of thought was. How could a dead bug even pollinate? What does that even look like? We got third place, so it held some validity in the eyes of the judges.</p>

                <p>Memory 3</p>
                <p>The year was 2013. The month was January. I was in my sophomore year of high school. I was sitting in Geometry Class when all of a sudden we all heard the following song: Harlem Shake by Baauer. Some seniors decided that for the senior prank, they would perform the Harlem Shake in the main lobby of the school. Forest Hills High School had 4,000 students. So, instead, chaos erupted.</p>

                <p>The lead of the plan got into trouble. In retaliation, his friends roamed around the entire school throwing food, pushing people, doing all sorts of things. I don't really even know since we were placed in lockdown and had to stay in the same room until the deans caught all of them. It was crazy!</p>

                <p>Memory 4</p>
                <p>During high school was the first time that I got to visit my mom's side of the family. I had never met them before that. It was also my first time travelling internationally. They live in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I fell in love with Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest. It is the most beautiful place in the world. I only wish that I had let myself have fun instead of worrying about homework and grades. I think the one piece of advice I would like to give high school me is to take it easy! It's okay to have fun and it's okay to take a break. Grades are important, but so is quality time with your family and friends. If you pay close attention to the photo with the balloons in the back, you'll see that I had turned sixty years old during my trip there. Skipped from 16 to 60 because of all the unnecessary stress I would put on myself.</p>

                <p>Note</p>
                <p>If you look at the first few pictures of Forest Hills High School, you'll see that in the distance you could see Queens College, which was close to where I lived. I like to think of this as a representation of how everything in life always ends up coming to full circle. I always wanted to go to Queens College because I was constantly passing by it. The campus is pretty. And it was close to home. And from Forest Hills High School, I was constantly getting a peek of my future.</p>

                <h4>Key Memories</h4>

                <p>Memory 1</p>
                <p>I remember during the orientation before freshman year, the advisor had asked if we all registered for classes. Since I was the first person in my family to go to college, I didn't realize that we were supposed to register for classes. I thought they just gave us our schedule like how they did in high school. I ended up having the worst schedule; large gaps between my classes, having to take calculus at night. I wasn't even able to use Rate My Professor because I was sitting right in front of the advisor and didn't want to seem rude. It was terrible. The days grew shorter and I remember one October night, I started crying as I walked around campus waiting for class to start. I was sad because I was so overwhelmed by everything. All of a sudden, I realized that I'm turning 18 at the end of the semester, I'm going to be an adult. And that was scary because that meant change and I don't like change. I had to start thinking about my future and what that looked like and I didn't even know where to start.</p>

                <p>Memory 2</p>
                <p>There are a few places on campus that were my go to throughout all four years. The first is Kiely Hall which is where all my math classes took place. I loved taking math classes. Queens College has a really great Math Department. However, the building could have used a little work. Without doubt, there was always a roach in the bathroom and I hated that. The second place was Powdermaker Hall which is where all my education courses took place. This building was newer compared to Kiely Hall, but if you took the stairwell down to the basement, there were always upside down roaches on the stairwell. The third place was the outdoor theatre. Fantastic place to cry in solitude when you were overwhelmed with finals. 10 out of 10 recommend. Also, during the night time, it's a fantastic place to see the moon and stars.</p>
                <p>The fourth place was the library which I loved. The sixth floor had the most amazing view and you were able to see the city skyline. It was so close, you could almost touch it. Jumping to the present a little bit, but now I'm going to school in the city to complete my master's and work in Brooklyn Heights, which is basically almost the city - it's only a stop away from Manhattan. See how things in life come to full circle. Something else that I was able to see in the distance was Forest Hills High School. So, from Queens College, I was constantly able to get a peek into my past. Life is a circle, if you look hard enough and keep your eyes open, you'll always be able to get a peek into your past and your future.</p>

                <p>Memory 3</p>
                <p>I did work study when I was in undergrad. My first year of work study was completed at the art library. I loved it. I enjoyed the process of putting different periodicals together to be bound as a completed volume and shelving the books back using the Library of Congress Classification. It was relaxing. I enjoyed reading through the magazines I was putting together to be bound and being in awe of how creatively put together everything was. I would work Saturday's and would be the only person on the floor those days. That was the best, having the whole library to myself. I looked forward to Saturdays. I would bring hot chocolate, sit by the floor to ceiling windows and look at the view. Then, I'd wander around the library, enjoying the silence and peace. The office had a lot of pictures from back in the 80s and 90s. Everything looked so much simpler during that time.</p>

                <p>Memory 4</p>
                <p>I worked Macy's holiday season the winter of 2017-18. I remember working on my twentieth birthday. I wasn't sad that I was working on my birthday. I was sad that I was no longer a teen. Now I'm twenty. And I remember being so emotional that I was getting older and that time was moving so fast. At this point, I was a junior in college, so I was also thinking about how in another year, I'm going to be done with college. And the unknown of the future was scary. At that time, in my head, getting older meant getting closer to the unknown that is the real world. That was not a fun prospect to look towards. Thankfully, my irrational fear was incorrect. Life after college is very fulfilling and there is no moment life starts or ends. You make of it what you want to. And that's exciting because I have the power to create and engage in meaningful experiences that make life joyous and beautiful. My sister took full advantage of my breakdown and took pictures of me blubbering. Thanks sis, thanks.</p>

                <p>Meadow Lake has been a significant location in more recent times. It was my go to place for morning walks to ease my anxiety and stress. Earlier this year, I was going through some very stressful events. It was very difficult as I was constantly feeling anxious, worried, overwhelmed, and stressed. So much so that instead of seeing the future, all I saw was a cloud of gray. I would come here during dawn so that I could watch the sunrise. I would try to tell myself that just like how night turns to day every morning before my very eyes, I will also get through this dark period and find light in my life again.</p>

                <p>I'm going to keep this one short because I'm still dealing with feelings from this place and the memories that it holds. In short, I met some amazing people here. Overtime, some friendships fell apart. I'm very grateful to have met them and that we were able to be in each other's life for a period of time. I grew a lot as a person because of them and will treasure the memories made forever. I miss them and I wish them the very best as we move onto the next chapters of our lives.</p>

                <p>Right now, I am happy with where I am in my life. There are moments where I feel down because of certain things that happened, but everything happens for a reason. I'm confident that things are working out as they are meant to. I'm completing my master's at the CUNY Graduate Center. I'm wrapping up my first semester and am loving every moment of it. I am surrounded my so much inspiration, and as a result, have started some creative projects on the side.</p>
                <p>I travelled solo for the first time in February 2022 to Seattle, WA. I never thought I would be confident enough to travel alone. I feel like the experience helped me gain confidence in myself and who I am. I struggled with low self-esteem growing up, so it was a long journey to get to a point where I recognized that I don't need validation from other's to feel worthy as a person; other people's perception of me shouldn't make me feel less than. I am me and I am awesome just as I am. This trip really reinforced the idea that it's okay to be alone, it's not okay to try to be someone you're not so that you can fit in and people will accept you so that you aren't alone.</p>
                <p>I'm starting to be more observant of the world around me. There's little messages all over the city. And it's nice that they always appear when I need it the most. The most important ones that I've encountered is "Smile because you can" and "Smile because it's not over." As I said, there are times where I feel down when I think of some things that happened and how they turned out. I think for some time, I wasn't allowing myself to be happy because of these events. But, with a lot of support from my mom and sister, I'm working towards overcoming these feelings and allowing myself to take the burden off of myself. And while at times it feels like some things in my life are completely over, it just means that it's the universe's way of making space for something new... something better.</p>
